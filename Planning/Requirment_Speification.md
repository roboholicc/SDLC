## Game Overview
Our game is a reskinned version of Space invaders. It is a fixed shooter where the player as a wizard must defeat fantasy creatures (dragons, goblins, ogres, ect) to defend the kingdom's castle. The main character can collect power ups in order to attack stronger beasts. If too many monsters get past the wizard it is game over and the kingdom gets defeated.
The main goal of the game is to be an engaging game accessible for all ages and all skill levels. Those who are seeking a casual gaming experience will find this game entertaining to pass the time. This comes alongside keeping people at higher skill levels engaged as the game gets increasingly harder and seeking to reach new highscores.
