## 1. App Idea

Our game is a reskinned version of Space invaders. It is a fixed shooter where the player as a wizard must defeat fantasy creatures (dragons, goblins, ogres, ect) to defend the kingdom's castle. The main character can collect power ups in order to attack stronger beasts. If too many monsters get past the wizard it is game over and the kingdom gets defeated.

## 2. Target Audience

This game is designed for all ages who enjoy a simple arcade experience. Those who enjoy fantasy themes alongside fixed shooter gameplay will find this game most appealing. People who are fans of the original Space Invaders will enjoy this nice reskin of it for a new visually appealing experience.

## 3. Goals and Vision

An engaging game accessible for all ages and all skill levels. Those who are seeking a casual gaming experience will find this game entertaining to pass the time. This comes alongside keeping people at higher skill levels engaged as the game gets increasingly harder and seeking to reach new highscores. Getting further into the experience allows players to see the new reskinned mobs and powerups altered to fit the fantasy theme.

## 4. Key Features

List out the main features of your game. What will the game do? Include both gameplay features and any technical requirements.
Example:
 • Single-player mode with multiple levels.
 • Power-ups that give the player special abilities for a limited time.
 • Enemies that the player must avoid or defeat.
 • All assets and features are successfully reskinned to fit the theme.

## 5. Success Criteria

The game will be considered sucsessful once it runs without any major bugs to impact the expereience. The game should be enjoyable for the target audience and get increasingly more dificult as the player progresses and gains more points. The continued powerups should keept the game entertaining and visually appealing. The reskin should be a nice addition to the expeience and add new interest to continue.

## 6. Technical Requirements

This game should be capable of running on all devices. On PC only keyboard is necessary, using arrow keys or wasd to move and space to shoot. On console joystick and buttons are needed. Finally for mobile there should be on screen buttons in order for the player to go left and right and tapping the screen should trigger shooting.
